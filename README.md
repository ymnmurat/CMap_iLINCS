#CMap_iLINCS

Currently under development

Analysis pipelines include analyses of data derived from ConnectivityMap, iLINCS and SwissTarget Prediction platforms. More specifically, users can import connectivity and expression profiles from knockdown (kd) and overexpression (oe) studies of respective cell lines and treatments, contrast upregulated/downregulated genes and pathways between the treatments and collect heatmap and upset plot representations along with csv files for the respective comparisons. In addition, target prediction scores from SwissTargetPrediction tool and gene expression values (RNAseq, qPCR) from in-house experiments can be incorporated into the analysis workflow. Accordingly, the users can visually inspect overlaps between their own experiments side-by-side with reference kd/oe studies and possible targets of the respective treaments. Hence, they can make data-driven decisions for their follow-up studies.
